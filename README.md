ABSTRACT:

In today's fast-paced and technology-driven world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is challenging for working professionals who spend long hours seated at their desks. Prolonged sitting has been linked to numerous health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and musculoskeletal problems. The "IoT-Based Smart Chair" project addresses these concerns by integrating advanced IoT technologies into a conventional office chair to monitor and enhance user health. This innovative solution combines various sensors to track critical health parameters and environmental conditions, providing real-time feedback and promoting healthier habits through a gamified approach. It employs an ultrasonic sensor to detect occupancy, a load cell paired with an amplifier to track sitting duration, and a MAX30100 sensor to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen levels. 

Data collected by these sensors is processed by an ESP32 microcontroller and displayed on a user-friendly interface developed using Figma. The interface allows users to view health metrics in realtime and receive alerts and recommendations to improve their habits. Gamification elements, such as rewards for taking breaks and maintaining optimal health parameters, enhance user engagement and motivation. The IoT-Based Smart Chair aims to mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged sitting and fosters a proactive approach to health management, representing a significant advancement in the intersection of technology and health.
